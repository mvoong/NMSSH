# NMSSH

This is a complete rewrite of the previous NMSSH library. The goal is to
create a clean, easy-to-use, test driven Cocoa framework that wraps libssh2.

NMSSH was initially built for usage in [Kleio](http://9muses.se/kleio) - a Mac OSX application that simplifies continuous deployment.

**Using libssh2 version:** `1.4.2`

Are you using NMSSH for something cool? [Let me know](http://twitter.com/Lejdborg).

## Usage

### Install the framework

* Build the framework and add it to your project. Consult the Wiki for detailed information about how to build for [OSX](https://github.com/Lejdborg/NMSSH/wiki/Build-and-use-in-your-OSX-project).
* Add `#include <NMSSH/NMSSH.h>` to your source file.

### Connect to a server

#### 1. Create a new session

    NMSSHSession *session = [NMSSHSession connectToHost:@"127.0.0.1:22"
                                           withUsername:@"user"];

    if ([session isConnected]) {
        NSLog(@"Successfully created a new session");
    }

#### 2.1. Authenticate by password

    [session authenticateByPassword:@"pass"];

#### 2.2. Or by public key

    // Explicitly set the public key that should be used...
    // Pass nil as password parameter for unprotected keys
    [session authenticateByPublicKey:@"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
                         andPassword:@"pass"];

#### 2.3. Or connect to a SSH agent

    [session connectToAgent];

#### 3. Check if authentication was successful

    if ([session isAuthorized]) {
        NSLog(@"Authentication succeeded");
    }

#### 4. Don't forget to disconnect

    [session disconnect];
    session = nil;

### Using Channels

#### Executing shell commands

    NSError *error = nil;
    NSString *response = [[session channel] execute:@"echo foo" error:&error];
    NSLog(@"Response: %@", response);

#### SCP file transfer

The SCP API provides a simple way to upload or download files.

The `to:` parameter is flexible in that if you provide a directory, it will keep the same filename as in the from-parameter. But if you provide a complete file name you may name the transferred file anything you want.

#### Uploading files from your local computer

    BOOL success = [[session channel] uploadFile:@"~/my-local-file.txt" to:@"/var/www/"];

#### Downloading files from a server

    BOOL success = [[session channel] downloadFile:@"/var/www/my-remote-file.txt" to:@"~/"];

### SFTP

#### Connect to SFTP

    NMSFTP *sftp = [NMSFTP connectWithSession:session];

    if ([sftp isConnected]) {
        // do stuff...
    }

    [sftp disconnect];

#### Create directory

    BOOL success = [sftp createDirectoryAtPath:@"/var/www/new-dir/"];

#### Delete directory

    BOOL success = [sftp removeDirectoryAtPath:@"/var/www/dir/"];

#### Create symlink

    BOOL success = [sftp createSymbolicLinkAtPath:@"/var/www/symlink" withDestinationPath:@"/var/www/new-dir/"];

#### Delete file

    BOOL success = [sftp removeFileAtPath:@"/var/www/file.txt"];

## Compatibility

NMSSH is built for Mac OSX. The code should work just fine with iOS as well if you create a new iOS static library project and copy the files and configuration from the main project.
